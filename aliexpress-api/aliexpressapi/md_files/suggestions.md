🏗 Suggested Next Steps

If your goal is real-world AliExpress clone:

Add nested routes for variants (so frontend can fetch attributes per product).

Add filter backend for ProductsViewSet (search, price range, category filter).

Add cache invalidation signals.

Start writing unit tests for ViewSets (pytest + pytest-django).

Eventually: integrate Elasticsearch / Meilisearch for product search (scale).
