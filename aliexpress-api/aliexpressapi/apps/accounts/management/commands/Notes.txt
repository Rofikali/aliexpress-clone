********** Gemerate Products and import_products **************
Step 1: Create a management command to generate products JSON
    Inside products/management/commands/, create:
    generate_products_json.py

Step 2: Run the command to generate 100 products
    python manage.py generate_products_json ./apps/accounts/management/fake_products.json --count 100

Step 3: Import into your Product model
    Now use the import_products command we wrote earlier:
    python manage.py import_products ./apps/accounts/management/fake_products.json
    python manage.py import_products ./apps/accounts/management/fake_products.json --format json
