Notes, rationale & production advice (short)

Blacklist & Logout: token.blacklist() uses DB tables provided by rest_framework_simplejwt.token_blacklist. This works without Redis; later you can replace/augment with Redis for performance.

Rotation: ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS and BLACKLIST_AFTER_ROTATION in settings give good replay-protection defaults.

Where to put business checks: keep them in CustomTokenObtainPairSerializer (login time) or in Permission classes — authentication should remain a thin identity-checking layer.

Tokens at registration: I kept token issuance at register like your previous flow. If you prefer no tokens until verification, remove _create_token_pair_for_user(user) from RegisterViewSet and instead issue tokens in EmailVerificationConfirmViewSet after setting is_email_verified=True.

Email sending: you currently send sync — fine for now. Switch to Celery or a background worker for production.

Logging & metrics: replace print() with structured logging (JSON) and metrics events for OTP requests/verify attempts.

If you want, I can now:

Produce the alternate variant where tokens are issued only after email verification (full file diffs),

Or output a one-click patch/diff (unified diff) you can apply,

Or create pytest integration tests for register → request OTP → confirm → login flows.

Which one next?
