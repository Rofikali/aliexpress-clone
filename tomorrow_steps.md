1Ô∏è‚É£ Separate Endpoints per Section Type

Instead of a single /homepage-detail/{id}/, split logically:

Section	List Endpoint	Detail Endpoint	Notes
Banners	/homepage/banners/	/homepage/banners/{id}/	Returns carousel banners. Optionally include related product links.
Categories	/homepage/categories/	/homepage/categories/{id}/	Top N categories, detail returns products in that category.
Featured Products	/homepage/featured/	/homepage/featured/{id}/	Top featured products, detail returns product info + images + stock info.
Promotions	/homepage/promotions/	/homepage/promotions/{id}/	Promo details, optionally include linked products or discount rules.

‚úÖ Advantages:

Each endpoint can be optimized separately.

Easier to cache different sections at different intervals.

Reduces heavy nested queries for the homepage.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Nested Data Carefully

For detail endpoints, you can fetch related items:

Banner ‚Üí optional product IDs for ‚ÄúShop now‚Äù buttons.

Category ‚Üí products within that category (limit to 10‚Äì20 for homepage).

Featured product ‚Üí product metadata, images, stock info, pricing.

Avoid fetching unnecessary deeply nested data for list endpoints; keep them lightweight.

3Ô∏è‚É£ DRF Routing Example

Using DRF + ViewSets + Nested Routers, it would look like:

# urls.py
from django.urls import path, include
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from apps.home.views import BannerViewSet, CategoryViewSet, FeaturedViewSet, PromotionViewSet

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register("banners", BannerViewSet, basename="banner")
router.register("categories", CategoryViewSet, basename="category")
router.register("featured", FeaturedViewSet, basename="featured")
router.register("promotions", PromotionViewSet, basename="promotion")

urlpatterns = [
    path("homepage/", include(router.urls)),
]


Then in ViewSets:

# banners
class BannerViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
    queryset = Banner.objects.filter(is_active=True)
    serializer_class = BannerSerializer

# categories
class CategoryViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
    queryset = Category.objects.filter(is_active=True)[:10]
    serializer_class = CategorySerializer

# featured products
class FeaturedViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
    queryset = Product.objects.filter(is_featured=True)[:10]
    serializer_class = ProductSerializer

4Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Integration

In Nuxt3, you can now fetch each section independently:

const banners = await $fetch('/api/v1/homepage/banners/')
const topCategories = await $fetch('/api/v1/homepage/categories/')
const featuredProducts = await $fetch('/api/v1/homepage/featured/')


Clicking a banner or category fetches /homepage/banners/{id}/ or /homepage/categories/{id}/ for progressive hydration.

üîπ Benefits

Scalable: Each section is independently cacheable.

Performance: Lightweight list fetch ‚Üí fast render.

Progressive hydration: Only fetch detail when user interacts.

Future-ready: You can add more sections like flash sales, trending products, etc.

If you want, I can design the full DRF backend + Nuxt3 compositional frontend using this approach, exactly like AliExpress/Amazon homepage, so you can handle millions of users efficiently.

Do you want me to do that next?
