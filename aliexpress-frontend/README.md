🔑 Flow now looks like:
UI → Composable → Store → Service → API
🔑 Flow now looks like:

UI → Composable → Store → Service → API

Composable (useInfiniteScrollProducts): Handles viewport & triggers loading.

Store (productStore): Holds products, pagination state, errors.

Service (productService): Talks to API, no state.

Composable useApi: Handles auth, refresh token, base URL.

This is already a tiered, enterprise-style architecture —
UI ➝ Composables ➝ Store ➝ Service ➝ API ➝ Backend


🧩 Layer-by-Layer Explanation
1. UI Layer 
    (Pages & Components)

2. Composables
    Composables handle “how to interact with data”, not “where data comes from.”

3. Pinia Store (State Layer)
    Think of the store as the brain of the frontend. Composables and UI ask the store for data instead of calling APIs directly.

4. Service Layer (Transport Wrappers)
    Services = translators. They normalize raw API responses and provide a consistent contract to the store.



I’ll cover:

Big picture flow & responsibilities

Concrete mapping to your code layers (what belongs where)

System design patterns (caching, SSR, pagination, auth, retries, circuit breaker)

Scalability & infra for huge scale

Observability, testing, CI/CD, security

Practical checklist & next steps you can act on

1. High-level flow (one-line)

UI (pages/components) → Composables (behavior) → Store (state) → Service (transport) → API Gateway → Backend services (microservices) → Data stores & infra.

2. Responsibilities by layer (concise)
UI (Pages & Components)

Presentational: markup, styles, accessibility, skeletons, virtualization.

No business logic, no direct network calls (except ephemeral public endpoints).

Use v-if/skeleton/aria states, image optimizations (responsive srcset / lazy / placeholders).

Example: pages/index.vue consumes useInfiniteScrollProducts() and only renders.

Composables (behavior)

Encapsulate reusable behaviors: infinite-scroll, debounced search, filters, retries, optimistic updates.

Accept store/service functions (dependency injection) to stay domain-agnostic.

Manage AbortController, SSR hydration concerns, and viewport fill.

Store (Pinia) — Single Source of Truth

Centralize domain state, normalization, caching, operations (fetchFirst, loadMore, applyFilters, reset).

Implement optimistic updates, entity maps (byId), TTL cache keys, and selectors.

Expose small "verbs" (actions) that UI calls.

Services (Transport wrappers)

Thin wrappers around endpoints. Use useApi with centralized retry/circuit-breaker/auth refresh. Normalize API shape.

Return predictable { data, error, status } or throw with normalized error object depending on your preference.

Keep domain mapping here (flatten nested API objects into friendly shapes for store).

API Gateway / Edge

Auth, rate-limiting, routing, request shaping, A/B flags, web application firewall (WAF).

Cache SSR pages and common API responses at edge (CDN + edge workers).

Backend (microservices)

Small, focused services: products, users, orders, payments, search, recommendations, images.

Each service owns its datastore and API contract.

Use async messaging (Kafka/Rabbit) for eventual consistency: inventory, order processing, emails, analytics.

Data stores & infra

Databases: OLTP (Postgres / CockroachDB / MySQL) with read replicas; NoSQL where needed (Dynamo/Cassandra) for extreme scale.

Search: Elasticsearch / Typesense / OpenSearch for product search.

Cache: multi-layered Redis (hot caches) + CDN (edge).

Object Storage: S3-compatible for media and static content; image CDN (Thumbor, Imgix, Cloudinary).

Message queue: Kafka/Rabbit for async flows.

3. End-to-end request flow (user searches for “phone”)

User types in search box (UI). Composable debounces input and calls store action setSearchQuery.

Store sets query in state → calls service searchProducts({ q, page_size }).

Service calls $api('/products/search', { params }) (useApi handles auth, retries, circuit breaker).

API Gateway receives request → edge cache lookup; if miss → forwards to Search service.

Search service queries Elasticsearch → returns normalized result.

Service normalizeResponse returns { data, error } to store.

Store updates products and hasNext. UI sees reactive updates.

4. Concrete mapping to your codebase (practical)

You already have the right idea. Map like this:

pages/index.vue → UI

Only imports useInfiniteScrollProducts and renders products.

~/composables/products/useInfiniteScrollProducts.js → Composable wrapper

Creates fetchProducts, resetProducts delegating to store.

~/stores/modules/productStore.js → Pinia store

Implements fetchFirst, loadMore, reset, caching, byId map.

~/services/api/product.js → Service

Thin wrappers: getProducts(params), getProductById(id).

Use normalizeResponse.

~/composables/core/useApi.js → Transport core

Global retry/backoff, refresh tokens, circuit breaker, error shaping.

API Gateway (infra) → CDN + WAF + Rate-limit + routing.

5. Important production patterns & code suggestions
a) SSR + SEO + first-content render

Server-render the first page of product grid (Nuxt asyncData/serverPrefetch or use useFetch server-side).

Hydrate client with same store state to avoid double-fetch.

Strategy: Page-level fetchFirst() on server, store initial data in Pinia state via server-side plugin.

b) Caching layers

Edge CDN (Cloudflare/Akamai) cache for public product pages and images (long TTL, stale-while-revalidate).

API-level caching for heavy-read endpoints (product lists, categories).

App-level cache in store with TTL and forceRefresh option.

Use Cache-Control and ETags for conditional requests.

c) Pagination & infinite scroll

Prefer cursor-based pagination (your API uses next_cursor) — better for dynamic datasets.

Store next_cursor in state, never compute page arithmetic from arrays.

De-duplicate by id using a byId map in store when appending.

d) Resilience: retries, backoff, circuit breaker

useApi handles:

Retries with exponential backoff on 5xx/network errors.

On 401, try refresh token via refresh endpoint; if fails, logout.

Circuit breaker to fast-fail when many 5xx errors occur (cooldown window).

Keep these concerns in useApi so services & stores are clean.

e) Optimistic UI & idempotency

For likes/add-to-cart: update UI optimistically and retry/sync in background.

Backend must expose idempotent endpoints for retry-safe operations (idempotency keys for payment/checkout).

f) Throttling

On client side, prevent spamming expensive actions (debounce search, throttle filter changes).

Server side: rate-limiting per user/IP + burst allowances.

g) Security

HTTPS everywhere, secure cookies (HttpOnly) for refresh tokens; access token in memory; CSRF protection for forms.

Validate inputs server-side; follow OWASP top 10.

Use signed URLs for private media access when needed.

h) Observability & tracing

Instrument frontend with Sentry for errors and user traces.

Add OpenTelemetry to backend; propagate trace headers from frontend.

Central logs (Elastic/Datadog), metrics (Prometheus & Grafana), APM for latency hotspots.

i) Search & recommendations

Use a dedicated search service (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch/Typesense). Keep search indexing near real-time via events.

Recommendation engine: offline ML (batch) + online features cache; serve recommendations via dedicated microservice backed by Redis.

6. Scalability blueprint (1B+ users mindset)

This is a summary of the changes to scale horizontally and safely:

Frontend & Edge

Serve static SPA from CDN edge (HTML edge caching for SSR pages).

Use Edge Workers for personalization & A/B at edge (do lightweight personalization by cookies).

Image CDN + automatic resizing + WebP/AVIF.

API & Backend

API Gateway (Kong/Envoy) + microservices behind (Kubernetes/ECS):

Autoscale stateless services using HPA / cluster autoscaler.

Stateful DB scaled via read replicas / sharding.

Use async event-driven architecture for non-real-time tasks (orders, emails).

Partition data by tenant/region where needed (geo-sharding for latency).

Data

OLTP: Postgres with read replicas / partitioning (or CockroachDB for global distribution).

Hot cache: Redis clusters with clustering & eviction policies for sessions and per-user caches.

Search: Elastic cluster with good sharding/replica strategy.

Object store: S3 + multi-region replication.

Operations

Canary deployments, blue/green or progressive rollouts.

Chaos testing (simulate failovers).

Automated infra as code (Terraform), pipelines (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / Jenkins).

Cost & tradeoffs

Caching / CDN reduce compute cost dramatically.

Precompute denormalized read models for highly read endpoints (e.g., product listing views).

7. Testing & CI/CD
Tests

Unit tests: composables, stores, services (mock transport).

Integration: store + service + mock server (MSW).

E2E: Playwright/Cypress against staging.

Performance tests: k6 / Gatling for API, client-side lighthouse budget.

CI/CD

Lint + unit tests on PR → run E2E on staging (merge gate).

Canary deploy to small percentage → analyze metrics → promote to prod.

Rollback automation on error thresholds.

8. Example concrete rules & snippets (to adopt immediately)
Store: normalized append (Pinia)
function appendProducts(newItems) {
  for (const p of newItems) byId.set(p.id, p)
  list.push(...newItems.filter(p => !listIds.has(p.id)))
}

useApi skeleton features

Exponential backoff + retries

401 refresh token flow

Circuit breaker

Normalize to { data, error, status }

(You already implemented these — keep it and centralize metrics/logs there.)

Edge caching headers (recommended)
Cache-Control: public, max-age=60, stale-while-revalidate=300, stale-if-error=86400

9. Short checklists (quick actionable)
For your frontend codebase (priority)

 Ensure useApi is single source for auth + retries + circuit breaker.

 Pinia stores own state and expose fetchFirst / loadMore / reset.

 useInfiniteScroll is generic and only needs loadMore + hasNext + isLoading.

 Server-render first page via Nuxt for SEO.

 Implement image CDN + lazy loading + responsive images.

 Add Sentry + Frontend metrics (LCP/FCP).

For backend & infra

 Put product listing behind a read-optimized API (cacheable).

 Use search service for text queries.

 Implement idempotency for critical endpoints (checkout).

 Implement observability + tracing from frontend to backend.

 Add rate-limiting & WAF.

10. Next steps I recommend you do now

Confirm your useApi has retry/backoff and circuit breaker (you already made this — great). Add metrics logging for failures.

Convert useInfiniteScrollProducts to call productStore.loadMore() and ensure productStore uses cursor next_cursor (not page math). You’re already close.

Implement SSR first-page rendering for product listing pages.

Add normalizeResponse helper and use it across services.

Add frontend monitoring (Sentry) and APM instrumentation (trace headers).

Plan infra: CDN + read-replica DB + elasticsearch + Redis (start small, iterate).

Final words (senior advice)

Build layers once and keep responsibilities strict. That pays off exponentially as the app grows.

Favor read-optimized design: product listing must be cheap to serve. Use caching and precomputed views.

Automate observability from day 1 — you can’t fix what you can’t measure.

Keep the frontend fast: SSR critical content, lazy load everything else, use CDN for static/images.
